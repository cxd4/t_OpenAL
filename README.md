t_OpenAL
========

My audio learning experiment for notetaking how to use OpenAL.

Generally useless OpenAL audio tester by Iconoclast.
* 1.  Just have the OpenAL and ALUT DLLs installed by the EXE.
* 2.  Have some file named "test.wav" in the EXE folder to test in the EXE.
* 3.  Be able to build the C source so that the EXE exists. :P
